The open source demo version has fallen woefully behind it's commercial counterparts.
If you would like to help develop django-school please feel free to branch or repurpose.
You can contact skylar.saveland@gmail.com with any questions or comments.

I guess the MIT or GPL license could go here?


Summary
=======

Django School (Quince) is a web-based school information system.  The system is very customizable
so that the school can get exactly what it wants and not more.  No extra functionality will be left 
to clutter or confuse.  The system is intuitive and easy to learn.  

All information can be retrieved with a few clicks and is searchable and sortable.  Get any obscure
information stored in the system instantly!  Beautiful, unobtrusive Ajax where it is merited.  Ready to
integrate existing design/logos/styles/flash resources or to create new ones.

If the school desires a feature that is not currently in Quince it should be relatively straight-forward 
to add.  We look forward to defining further needs and specifications with you so we can improve Quince.
